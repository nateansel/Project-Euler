 # Right triangles with integer coordinates
 [Problem 91](https://projecteuler.net/problem=91) - Difficulty level: 25%

 The points P (x₁, y₁) and Q (x₂, y₂) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

 There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
 0 ≤ x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂ ≤ 2.

 Given that 0 ≤ x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂ ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?
